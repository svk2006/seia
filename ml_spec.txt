For your climate decision support platform targeting crop stress advisories, here is a concise-ML input-output design and model choice:
Inputs to the ML model:
Weather data features: temperature, humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed (from OpenWeatherMap, IMD, etc.)
Satellite-derived vegetation indices: NDVI, EVI (from NASA/ESA satellite imagery)
Soil moisture and temperature (if available)
Crop type and growth stage (user input or inferred)
Historical yield and stress event data (from collected reports)
Geo-location coordinates (to link environmental data spatially)
Recent user-submitted crop stress reports (optional, as labeled data)
Outputs from the ML model:
Crop stress level classification (e.g., no stress, mild, moderate, severe)
Stress type prediction (e.g., drought, pest infestation, nutrient deficiency)
Crop-specific timely advisory recommendations (e.g., irrigation alert, pest control advice)
Recommended Model:
Use a supervised learning model for classification:
Gradient Boosting Trees (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) for tabular data, due to interpretability and good performance on heterogeneous data.
Alternatively, a shallow neural network (Multi-layer Perceptron) if you have larger labeled data.
For satellite image feature extraction, use precomputed vegetation indices rather than raw Images to reduce complexity.
Optionally, add a time-series model (LSTM) if you have sequential weather and crop data over time.
Training Approach:
Collect historical labeled data combining environmental features and known crop stress outcomes (from past reports and satellite data).
Preprocess features: normalize weather data, encode categorical inputs (crop type).
Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the model minimizing classification loss (cross-entropy).
Tune hyperparameters via cross-validation.
Evaluate with metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix for stress class distinction.
Deploy the trained model as an API endpoint on your backend.
Additional Notes:
Start with a simple model (XGBoost) using tabular features for MVP.
Gradually incorporate more complex temporal or image-based models after initial validation.
