Project Overview:
Build a responsive, user-friendly climate decision support website that integrates open satellite/weather data, mapping, user reports, and advisory generation focused on crop stress and climate resilience.
Core Features:
User Authentication & Profiles:
Sign up/in with email or social login (Google/Facebook).
Profile management with basic info and location.
Role-based access: standard users and admin.
Homepage:
Clear project mission statement and value proposition.
Navigation menu: Home, How It Works, Dashboard, Submit Reports, Resources, Community, About.
Latest alerts and news ticker from integrated data.
How It Works Page:
Step-by-step explanation with visuals of data sources, advisory generation, user reporting, and community support.
User Dashboard:
Personalized view of local weather, satellite imagery overlays (using Mapbox/OpenStreetMap).
Crop stress advisories generated from ML model or rule-based logic.
Historical data visualization (charts/graphs) of local climate and crop status.
Notifications center for alerts via web push and SMS.
Submit Reports Page:
Form to upload geo-tagged images/photos (mobile camera or file upload).
Text input for observations or issues.
Auto-detect location from metadata or manual input.
Status tracking of submitted reports.
Resources Page:
Curated library with downloadable PDFs, videos, and links on climate-smart agriculture practices.
Search and filter by topic.
Community Page:
Discussion forum or Q&A board for farmers and experts.
User profiles with badges for contributors.
Moderation tools for admins.
About Page:
Team info, partners, and contact details.
Data sources and methodology transparency.
Technical Requirements:
Frontend: React.js with responsive design for desktop and mobile.
Backend: Node.js with Express or Django REST framework.
Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for geospatial queries.
Authentication: Firebase Auth or JWT-based system.
Mapping and Imagery: Integrate Mapbox GL or Leaflet for map rendering with layers from NASA Earthdata, ESA Copernicus, and OpenStreetMap.
Weather & Satellite Data API: Integrate NASA Earthdata API, OpenWeatherMap, and IMD APIs for real-time weather and satellite imagery updates.
Storage: AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for user-uploaded images and static assets.
ML Advisory Component: Lightweight crop stress detection model or rule-based logic implemented in Python or Node.js, integrated into backend API.
Notifications: Web push notifications and SMS alerts using Twilio or MSG91.
Deployment: Containerized app (Docker) deployed on AWS/GCP/Azure with CI/CD pipeline.
UI/UX Details:
Clean, modern, and accessible interface with clear typography and color coding for advisories.
Interactive maps with zoom, pan, and layer toggling.
Dashboard charts using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.
Mobile-first design with optimized image upload and offline support for reports.
Additional Notes:
Prioritize performance and scalability for handling many concurrent users and data requests.
Ensure data privacy and security best practices for user data.
Provide admin dashboard to manage users, reports, resources, and content.
Include multilingual support placeholders for future expansion.
Please build the website following the above detailed feature set, architecture, and design principles, delivering a fully functional prototype suitable for demonstration and user testing.
