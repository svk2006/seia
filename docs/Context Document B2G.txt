1. Problem Statement
Smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders lack timely, localized climate and crop stress information to make informed decisions, risking crop losses and reduced productivity. Existing solutions are fragmented, expensive, or not tailored to local crops and conditions.
2. Proposed Solution
A web and mobile platform offering localized, real-time climate advisory and crop stress alerts by integrating satellite/weather data, user reports, and lightweight ML models to provide actionable insights. Features include personalized dashboards, community support, resource libraries, and multi-channel communication (SMS, voice).
3. Implementation Plan
Phase 1 (0-12 h): MVP prototype with user authentication, dashboard, basic weather integration, report submission, and advisory delivery.
Phase 2 (1-2 weeks): Integrate ML models for crop stress detection, expand data sources, add community and resource sections.
Phase 3 (1 month+): Scale backend, optimize data processing, add multi-language support, improve UX/UI, deploy mobile apps.
4. Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (web), React Native or Flutter (mobile)
Backend: Node.js (Express) or Django (Python)
Database: Postgre SQL with Post GIS for geospatial data
Cloud Storage: AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for images and data
APIs: NASA Earthdata, ESA Copernicus, Open Weather Map, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Mapbox, Open Street Map
ML Frameworks: Tensor Flow/Tensor Flow Lite, Open CV (for image processing)
Communication: Twilio, MSG91 (SMS & voice messages)
Authentication: Firebase Auth or JWT-based system
Visualization: Mapbox GL, Leaflet, Grafana/Metabase for dashboards
5. Features
User Registration/Login with role-based access
Personalized Dashboard with weather, advisories, and crop status
Real-time weather and satellite data integration
Report/Image submission with geo-tagging
Automated crop stress advisory using ML/rule-based models
Resource library with localized best practices and market info
Community forum/support for peer-to-peer help
Multi-channel alerts: SMS, voice, push notifications
Admin panel for data moderation and analytics
6. Data Flow
Acquire Data:
Weather & satellite data via APIs; user reports/images uploaded.
Process Data: Backend aggregates, cleans, and stores data in Postgre SQL/Post GIS.
ML Analysis: Crop stress detection model ingests weather + image data, outputs
advisories.
Store Results: Advisories and processed data saved for user retrieval.
Deliver: Frontend fetches data for dashboards; alerts sent via SMS/voice APIs.
User Interaction: Users submit feedback/reports, closing the loop.
7. API Endpoints (examples)
POST /auth/register User registration
POST /auth/login User login
GET /dashboard/data Fetch user-specific weather & advisory data
POST /reports Submit crop report with geo-tagged image
GET /resources Fetch resource library content
GET /community/posts List community forum posts
POST /alerts/send Trigger alerts to users (admin)
GET /ml/advisory - Fetch latest ML-generated advisories
8. ML Inputs and Outputs
Inputs:
Weather parameters (temperature, humidity, rainfall) from APIs
Satellite imagery or user-submitted crop images
Historical crop health and environmental data
Outputs:
. Crop stress risk level (low/medium/high)
Recommended actions/advisories
Alerts for imminent climate threats
9. Data Acquisition
Open APIs: NASA Earthdata, ESA Copernicus for satellite data
Weather APIs: IMD, Open Weather Map for local weather conditions
Map Data: Open Street Map, Mapbox for geospatial mapping
User-generated data: Geo-tagged images and reports via app/web
Optional: Drone imagery or crowdsourced photos (future phase)
10. Target Crops
Focus on staple and high-impact crops relevant to target regions (e.g.):
Rice
Wheat
Maize
Pulses
Vegetables (region-specific)
